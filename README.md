#Image-Based Emotion Classification
This project implements a deep-learning–based sentiment analysis system that classifies human facial expressions into Happy, Neutral, and Sad categories.
A Custom ResNet architecture is used for feature extraction, while the Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) is employed for hyperparameter optimization to achieve high accuracy and stable learning.
